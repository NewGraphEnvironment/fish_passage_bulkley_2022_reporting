58067,NA,newgraph_airvine,1514888,Gramophone Creek,Telkwa high road,4,2,1,7,Erosion is present on upstream side of roadway. Significant embankment issues on downstream end at the outlet pool. Downstream end of main flow pipe is bent significantly downwards. There is corrosion in the overflow pipe causing the water to flow underneath the pipe. Holes in the overflow pipe are located approximately 1.8 m from the outlet. There are low overhead power lines at site.,2,1,2,9,Large stream but a low risk of a flood event having serious implications due to lack of infrastructure downstream and wetlands that would buffer sediment inputs.,6,5,8,9,10,8,46,55,Site on lower traffic gravel road. Detour available. Easy constructibility and low cost makes this a good candidate for replacement.

195943,NA,newgraph_airvine AN DN,1755230,Stock Creek,Barrett Station Road,3,2,1,6,Extensive erosion is present on the right bank on the downstream side. Very large outlet drop and deep outlet pool indicates culvert is undersized. Very little corrosion on the pipe. Pipe shape is good and not deformed.,2,2,4,10,Only one house visible downstream of the crossing. Road appears to have some traffic volume. Agricultural fields and minimal housing upstream and downstream.,2,2,6,7,10,8,35,45,"Appears as though Hagaman Road could be used as alternative access to the community, so impact on traffic is not high."
195944,NA,newgraph_airvine,3788405,Stock Creek,Highway 16,1,1,1,3,Condition appears to be good. There is no evidence of deformity and corrosion is minimal.,1,5,5,8,Fill is deep enough that a flood event would not affect the culvert.,10,5,5,5,10,1,36,44,"It would be difficult to do any construction on this section due to large amounts of fill. This site is located on a major highway, possibility for detours but cost would be high."
197653,NA,tieasha.pierre,2076530,Perow Creek,Highway 16,1,1,1,3,The culvert is in decent shape with some minor metal damage.,3,3,9,12,"The watershed is relatively large and the culvert is embedded so there is some risk of blockage before large release of flows upstream, possibly related to a beaver dam.",10,5,3,3,10,8,39,51,The crossing is on small low volume residential road with easy and fast detour during construction. Blow out affecting highway downstream would be of high consequence. Railway and one or two residential properties are located downstream.
197974,NA,newgraph_airvine,2076480,Watson Creek,Highway 16,5,3,1,9,Culvert is collapsing in the middle and is extensively eroded. Top end of the pipe is elevated from the stream bed at the inlet.,4,5,20,29,"The large size and depth of the outlet pool indicates that there is major flow that comes through here that is not well-accommodated by the 0.9 m pipe, along with the 0.6 m overflow which is adjacent to it.",10,10,1,1,10,8,40,69,"Although it would be an extremely expensive fix, this culvert looks to be a threat and closer investigation is warranted."
