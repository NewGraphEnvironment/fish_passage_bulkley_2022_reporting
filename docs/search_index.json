"],["intro.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction This report is part of a larger effort by the Society for Ecosystem Restoration Northern British Columbia (SERNbc) in the Skeena River watershed which began in 2020. Although this document discusses crossings in the the Bulkey River watershed group only (as defined by the Freshwater Atlas of BC), project activities since 2020 have also included sites in the Morice River watershed group with expansion of the study area in 2022 to include the Zymoetz Watershed Group and the Kispiox River watershed group. At the time of reporting, additional reporting related to 2022 fieldwork planning and results interpretation for these other watershed groups was underway and available here. Work in 2022 builds on planning which began in 2018 by Irvine (2018), documentation in Mazany-Wright et al. (2021) and reporting from field activities conducted in 2020 (Irvine 2021) and 2021 (Irvine 2022). Past years of SERNbc reporting can be viewed interactively here and here. Please note that at the time of reporting, this document was in draft format and changing over time. Version numbers are logged for each release with modifications, enhancements and other changes tracked here with issues tracked here. The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat (Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989; Diebel et al. 2015). Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues (Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997; Cote et al. 2005). As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement, relocation and deactivation designs. Although remediation and replacement of stream crossing structures can have benefits to local fish populations, the costs of remedial works can be significant and the impacts of the work often complex to evaluate and quantify. Additionally, allocation of ecosystem restoration funding towards infrastructure upgrades on transportation right of ways are not always considered ethical under all circumstances from all perspectives. When funds are finite and invested groups are engaged in fund raising, cost benefits and the ethics of crossing replacements should be explored collaboratively alongside the cost benefits and ethics of alternative investment activities including transportation corridor relocation/deactivation, land procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian/floodplain restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management, salt water interventions and research.

The Wet’suwet’en people are a matrilineal society organized into the Gilseyhu (Big Frog), Laksilyu (Small Frog), Tsayu (Beaver clan), Gitdumden (Wolf/Bear) and Laksamshu (Fireweed) clans. Within each of the clans there are are a number of kin-based groups known as Yikhs or House groups. The Yikh is a partnership between the people and the territory. Thirteen Yikhs with Hereditary Chiefs manage a total of 38 distinct territories upon which they have jurisdiction. Within a clan, the head Chief is entrusted with the stewardship of the House territory to ensure the Land is managed in a sustainable manner. Inuk Nu’at’en (Wet’suwet’en law) governing the harvesting of fish within their lands are based on values founded on thousands of years of social, subsistence and environmental dynamics. The Yintahk (Land) is the centre of life as well as culture and it’s management is intended to provide security for sustaining salmon, wildlife, and natural foods to ensure the health and well-being of the Wet’suwet’en (Office of the Wet’suwet’en 2013; “Office of the Wet’suwet’en” 2021; FLNRORD 2017). There are a total of six first nation bands that encompass the Wet’suwet’en. These are: Wet’suwet’en, Ts’il Kaz Koh, Hagwilget Village, Nee-Tahi-Buhn Band, Skin Tyee and Witset (“Wetʼsuwetʼen” 2022). 2.2 Gitxsan The Gitxsan Laxyip (traditional territories) covers an area of 33,000km2 within the Skeena River and Nass River watersheds. The Laxyip is governed by 60 Simgiigyet (Hereditary Chiefs), within the traditional hereditary system made up of Wilps (House groups). Anaat are fisheries tenures found throughout the Laxyip. Traditional governance within a matrilineal society operates under the principles of Ayookw (Gitxsan law) (“Gitxsan Huwilp Government” 2021). # Salmon is considered the source of life and always treated with high regard. It was brought by the Raven who also taught people how to fish and hunt. 2.3 Project Location knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/fishpassage_skeena_2022_bulk.png&quot;) Figure 2.1: Overview map of Study Areas The Bukley River is an 8th order stream that drains an area of 7,762 km2 in a generally northerly direction from Bulkley Lake on the Nechako Plateau to its confluence with the Skeena River at Hazleton. It has a mean annual discharge of 139.2 m3/s at station 08EE004 located near Quick (~27km south of Telkwa) and 19.4 m3/s at station 08EE003 located upstream near Houston. Flow patterns at Quick are heavily influenced by inflows from the Morice River (enters just downstream of Houston) resulting in flow patterns typical of high elevation watersheds which receive large amounts of precipitation as snow leading to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July (Figures 2.2 - 2.3). The hydrograph peaks faster and generally earlier (May - June) for the Bulkley River upstream of Houston where the topography is of lower lower elevation (Figures 2.2 and 2.4). Changes to the climate systems are causing impacts to natural and human systems on all continents with alterations to hydrological systems caused by changing precipitation or melting snow and ice increasing the frequency and magnitude of extreme events such as floods and droughts (IPCC 2014; ECCC 2016). These changes are resulting in modifications to the quantity and quality of water resources throughout British Columbia and are likely to compound issues related to drought and flooding in the Bulkley River watershed where numerous water licenses are held with a potential over-allocation of flows identified during low flow periods (ILMB 2007). The valley bottom has seen extensive settlement over the past hundred years with major population centers including the Village of Hazelton, the Town of Smithers, the Village of Telkwa and the District Municipality of Houston. As a major access corridor to northwestern British Columbia, Highway 16 and the Canadian National Railway are major linear developments that run along the Bulkley River within and adjacent to the floodplain with numerous crossing structures impeding fish access into and potentially out from important fish habitats. Additionally, as the valley bottom contains some of the most productive land in the area, there has been extensive conversion of riparian ecosystems to hayfields and pastures leading to alterations in flow regimes, increases in water temperatures, reduced streambank stability, loss of overstream cover and channelization (ILMB 2007; Wilson and Rabnett 2007). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EE004.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EE003.png&quot;) Figure 2.2: Hydrograph for Bulkley River at Quick (Station #08EE004) and near Houston (Station #08EE003). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EE004.png&quot;) Figure 2.3: Summary of hydrology statistics for Bulkley River at Quick (Station #08EE004 - daily discharge data from 1930 to 2018). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EE003.png&quot;) Figure 2.4: Summary of hydrology statistics for Bulkley River near Houston (Station #08EE003 - daily discharge data from 1980 to 2018). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EE004.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EE003.png&quot;) 2.4 Fisheries In 2004, IBM Business Consulting Services (2006) estimated the value of Skeena Fisheries at an annual average of $110 million dollars. The Bulkley-Morice watershed is an integral part of the salmon production in the Skeena drainage and supports an internationally renown steelhead, chinook and coho sport fishery (Tamblyn 2005). Traditionally, the salmon stocks passing through and spawning in Bulkley River were the principal food source for the Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en people living there (Wilson and Rabnett 2007). Wilson and Rabnett (2007) detail numerous fishing areas located within the lower Bulkley drainage (from the confluence of the Skeena to the confluence with the Telkwa River) and the upper Bulkley drainage which includes the mainstem Bulkley River and tributaries upstream of the Telkwa River confluence. Anadromous lamprey passing through and spawning in the upper Bulkley River were traditionally also an important food source for the Wet’suwet’en (Wilson and Rabnett 2007; pers comm. Mike Ridsdale, Environmental Assessment Coordinator, Office of the Wet’suwet’en). Approximately 11.3 km downstream of the Bulkley Lake outlet and just upstream of Watson Creek, the upper Bulkley falls is an approximately 4m high narrow rock sill that crosses the Bulkley River, producing a steep cascade section. This obstacle to fish passage is recorded as an almost complete barrier to fish passage for salmon during low water flows. Coho have not been observed beyond the falls since 1972 (Wilson and Rabnett 2007). Renowned as a world class recreational steelhead and coho fishery, the Bulkley River receives some of the heaviest angling pressure in the province. In response to longstanding angler concerns with respect to overcrowding, quality of experience and conflict amongst anglers, an Angling Management Plan was drafted for the river following the initiation of the Skeena Quality Waters Strategy process in 2006 and an extensive multi-year consultation process. The plan introduces a number of regulatory measures with the intent to provide Canadian resident anglers with quality steelhead fishing opportunities. Regulatory measures introduced with the Angling Management Plan include prohibited angling for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, Sept 1 - Oct 31 within the Bulkley River, angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, all year within the Suskwa River and angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens Sept 1 - Oct 31 in the Telkwa River. The Bukley River is considered Class II waterand there is no fshing permitted upstream of the Morice/Bulkley River Confluence (FLNRO 2013a, 2013b; FLNRORD 2019). 2.4.0.1 Fish Species Fish species recorded in the Bulkley River watershed group are detailed in Table 2.1 (MoE 2020a). Coastal cutthrout trout and bull trout are considered of special concern (blue-listed) provincially. Summaries of some of the Skeena and Bulkley River fish species life history, biology, stock status, and traditional use are documented in Schell (2003), Wilson and Rabnett (2007), Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall (2002) and Office of the Wet’suwet’en (2013). Wilson and Rabnett (2007) discuss chinook, pink, sockeye, coho, steelhead and indigenous freshwater Bulkley River fish stocks within the context of key lower and upper Bulkley River habitats such as the Suskwa River, Station Creek, Harold Price Creek, Telkwa River and Buck Creek. Key areas within the upper Bulkley River watershed with high fishery values, documented in Schell (2003), are the upper Bulkley mainstem, Buck Creek, Dungate Creek, Barren Creek, McQuarrie Creek, Byman Creek, Richfield Creek, Johnny David Creek, Aitken Creek and Emerson Creek. A draft gantt chart for select species in the Bulkley River watershed was derived from reviews of the aforementioned references and is included as Figure 2.5. The data is considered in draft form and will be refined over the spring and summer of 2021 with local fisheries technicians and knowledge holders during the collaboratory assessment planning and fieldwork activities planned. ##### Chinook # In the 1990&#39;s Morice River watershed, @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish estimated that chinook comprised 30% of the total Skeena system chinook escapements. @buckwalter_kirsch2012Fishinventory have recorded juvenile chinook rearing in small non natal streams. # @buckwalter_kirsch2012Fishinventory have uvenile chinook have been recorded rearing in small non natal streams #It is estimated that Morice River coho comprise approximatley 4% of the Skeena escapement with a declining trend noted since the 1950 in @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish. Coho spawn in major tributaries and small streams ideally at locations where downstream dispersal can result in seeding of prime off channel habitats including warm productive sloughs and side channels. Of all the salmon species, coho rely on small tributaries the most [@bustard_schell2002ConservingMorice]. @bustard_schell2002ConservingMorice report that much of the distribution of coho into non-natal tributaries occurs during high flow periods of May - early July with road culverts blocking migration into these habitats. Summaries of historical fish observations in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups (n=4033), graphed by remotely sensed average gradient as well as measured or modelled channel width categories for their associated stream segments where calculated with bcfishpass and bcfishobs and are provided in Figures 2.6 - 2.7. fiss_species_table &lt;- readr::read_csv(paste0(getwd(), &#39;/data/inputs_extracted/fiss_species_table.csv&#39;)) # filter(`Species Code` != &#39;CT&#39;) %&gt;% # fiss_species_table %&gt;% # my_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish species recorded in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups.&#39;) # # # if(gitbook_on){ # fiss_species_table %&gt;% # fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish species recorded in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups.&#39;) # } else fiss_species_table[1:41, ] %&gt;% # fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish species recorded in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups.&#39;, scroll = F) # # if(identical(gitbook_on, FALSE)){fiss_species_table[42:nrow(fiss_species_table), ] %&gt;% # fpr::fpr_kable(scroll = F)} fiss_species_table %&gt;% filter(!is.na(Bulkley)) %&gt;% select(-Bulkley, -Morice) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish species recorded in the Bulkley River watershed group.&#39;, scroll = gitbook_on) Table 2.1: Fish species recorded in the Bulkley River watershed group.

A Fish Passage Technical Working Group has been formed to coordinate the protocol and data is continuously amalgamated within the Provincial Steam Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS). The strategic approach protocol involves a four-phase process as described in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2014) : Phase 1: Fish Passage Assessment – Fish stream crossings within watersheds with high fish values are assessed to determine barrier status of structures and document a general assessment of adjacent habitat quality and quantity. Phase 2: Habitat Confirmation – Assessments of crossings prioritized for follow up in Phase 1 studies are conducted to confirm quality and quantity of habitat upstream and down as well as to scope for other potential nearby barriers that could affect the practicality of remediation. Phase 3: Design – Site plans and designs are drawn for priority crossings where high value fish habitat has been confirmed. Phase 4: Remediation – Re-connection of isolated habitats through replacement, rehabilitation or removal of prioritized crossing structure barriers. There is a rich history of fish passage restoration planning in the Bulkley River watershed group with not all the work documented in the PSCIS system. A non-exhaustive list of historic fish passage reports for the watershed includes Wilson and Rabnett (2007), McCarthy and Fernando (2015),Smith (2018) Casselman and Stanley (2010), Irvine (2018), Irvine (2021), Mazany-Wright et al. (2021) and Irvine (2022). Review of the PSCIS database indicated that prior to 2022, 1720 assessments for fish passage (Phase 1) and 38 habitat confirmations were recorded at crossing structures within the Bulkley River watershed MoE (2023b). Within the Bulkley River watershed group, a number of remediation projects have been completed over the years with backwatering works conducted on Toboggan Creek, Coffin Creek, Moan Creek, Johnny David Creek and potentially others. Three culvert replacements (with open bottom structures) in the watershed group have been tracked in PSCIS and include works on Barren Creek as well as two tributaries to Harold Prince Creek (MoE 2021b). McDowell Creek at Highway 16 was replaced with a horizontally drilled baffled structure in 2017 and the Highway 16 crossing over Taman Creek was replaced in 2022. Canadian Wildlife Federation led the removal of a collapsed bridge located on Robert Hatch Creek following assessment work completed by Irvine (2022). ##`r pscis_historic_phase1 %&gt;% filter(watershed_group_code %ilike% &#39;BULK&#39; &amp; assessment_date &lt; &#39;2020-01-01&#39;) %&gt;% nrow()` "],["methods.html", "3 Methods 3.1 Planning 3.2 Fish Passage Assessments 3.3 Habitat Confirmation Assessments 3.4 Reporting 3.5 Mapping", " 3 Methods Workflows for the project have been classified into planning, fish passage assessments, habitat confirmation assessments, reporting and mapping. All components leveraged R, SQL or Python programming languages to facilitate workflow tracking, collaboration, transparency and continually improving research. Project workflows utilized local and remote postgreSQL databases as well as a “snapshot” of select datasets contained within a local sqlite database. A data and script repository to facilitate this reporting is located on Github. source(&#39;scripts/packages.R&#39;) source(&#39;scripts/tables.R&#39;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) 3.1 Planning To identify priorities for crossing structure rehabilitation, background literature, fisheries information, PSCIS, and bcfishpass (Norris 2021d) outputs were reviewed. bcfishpass is an updated open-source code repository comprised of tools ported over from the Fish Habitat Model (Norris and Mount 2016) developed by the BC Ministry of Environment along with a number of significant upgrades and new features. Scripts within bcfishpass also pull and analyze data using other open-source tools such as bcdata (Norris 2021b), bcfishobs (Norris 2021c), and fwapg (Norris 2021a) which serve numerous functions related to open-data access as well as the analysis of the BC Freshwater Atlas, roads, fish and fish habitat in British Columbia. 3.1.1 Habitat Modelling bcfishpass calculates the average gradient of BC Freshwater Atlas stream network lines at minimum 100m long intervals starting from the downstream end of the streamline segment and working upstream. The network lines are broken into max gradient categories with new segments created if and when the average slope of the stream line segment exceeds user provided thresholds. For this project, the user provided gradient thresholds used to delineate “potentially accessible habitat” were based on estimated max gradients that salmon (15% - coho and chinook) and steelhead (20%) are likely to be capable of ascending. Through this initiative and other SERN/New Graph led initiatives, the Provincial Fish Passage Remediation Program and connectivity restoration planning by the Canadian Wildlife Federation (Mazany-Wright et al. 2021), bcfishpass has been designed to prioritize potential fish passage barriers for assessment or remediation. The software is under continual development and has been designed and constructed by Norris (2021d) using sql and python based shell script libraries to generate a simple model of aquatic habitat connectivity. The model identifies natural barriers (ex. steep gradients for extended distances) and hydroelectric dams to classifying the accessibility upstream by fish (Norris 2021d). On potentially accessible streams, scripts identify known barriers (ex. waterfalls &gt;5m high) and additional anthropogenic features which are primarily road/railway stream crossings (i.e. culverts) that are potentially barriers. To prioritize these features for assessment or remediation, scripts report on how much modelled potentially accessible aquatic habitat the barriers may obstruct. The model can be refined with known fish observations upstream of identified barriers and for each crossing location, the area of lake and wetland habitat upstream, species documented upstream/downstream, an estimate of watershed area (on 2nd order and higher streams), mean annual precipitation weighted to upstream watershed area and channel width can be collated using bcfishpass, fwapg and bcfishobs. This, information, can be used to provides an indication of the potential quantity and quality of habitat potentially gained should fish passage be restored by comparing to user defined thresholds for the aforementioned parameters. A discussion of the methodology to derive channel width is below. Gradient, channel size and stream discharge are key determinants of channel morphology and subsequently fish distribution. High value rearing, overwintering and spawning habitat preferred by numerous species/life stages of fish are often located within channel types that have relatively low gradients and large channel widths (also quantified by the amount of flow in the stream). Following delineation of “potentially accessible habitat”, the average gradient of each stream segment within habitat classified as below the 15% and 20% thresholds was calculated and summed within species and life stage specific gradient categories. Average gradient of stream line segments can be calculated from elevations contained in the provincial freshwater atlas streamline dataset. To obtain estimates of channel width upstream of crossing locations, Where available, bcfishpass was utilized to pull average channel gradients from Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS) site assessment data (MoE 2020d) or PSCIS assessment data (MoE 2021a) and associate with stream segment lines. When both FISS and PSCIS values were associated with a particular stream segment, FISS channel width was used. When multiple FISS sites were associated with a particular stream segment a mean of the average channel widths was taken. To model channel width for 2nd order and above stream segments without associated FISS or PSCIS sites, first fwapg was used to estimate the drainage area upstream of the segment. Then, rasters from ClimateBC (Wang et al. 2012) were sampled for each stream segments and a mean annual precipitation weighted by upstream watershed area was calculated. Mean annual precipitation was then combined with the channel widths and BEC zone information (gathered through a spatial query tied to the bottom of the stream segment) into a dataset (n = 22990) for analysis fo the relationship between these variables. The details of this analysis and resulting formula used to estimate channel width on stream segments in the Bulkley River is included as a technical appendix here. bcfishpass and associated tools have been designed to be flexible in analysis, accepting user defined gradient, channel width and stream discharge categories (MoE 2020d). Although currently in draft form, and subject to development revisions, gradient and channel width thresholds for habitat with the highest intrinsic value for a number of fish species in the Bulkley River watershed group have been specified and applied to model habitat upstream of stream crossing locations with the highest intrinsic value (Table 3.1). Thresholds were derived based on a literature review with references provided in Table 3.2. Output parameters for modelling are presented in Table 3.3. #`r if(identical(gitbook_on, FALSE)){knitr::asis_output(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;)}` bcfishpass_spawn_rear_model %&gt;% mutate(Species = fishbc::fbc_common_name(species_code), spawn_gradient_max = round(spawn_gradient_max * 100 ,1), rear_gradient_max = round(rear_gradient_max * 100 ,1)) %&gt;% select(Species, `Spawning Gradient Max (%)`= spawn_gradient_max, `Spawning Width Min (m)` = spawn_channel_width_min, # `Spawning Width Max (m)` = spawn_channel_width_max, # `Spawning MAD Min (m3/s)` = spawn_mad_min, # `Spawning MAD Max (m3/s)` = spawn_mad_max, `Rearing Gradient Max (%)` = rear_gradient_max, `Rearing Width Min (m)` = rear_channel_width_min) %&gt;% # `Rearing MAD Min (m3/s)` = rear_mad_min, # `Rearing MAD Max (m3/s)` = rear_mad_max, # `Rearing Wetland Multiplier` = rear_wetland_multiplier, # `Rearing Lake Multiplier` = rear_lake_multiplier) %&gt;% t() %&gt;% as_tibble(rownames = &quot;row_names&quot;) %&gt;% janitor::row_to_names(row_number = 1) %&gt;% rename(Variable = Species) %&gt;% select(-`Westslope Cutthroat Trout`, -`Arctic Grayling`, -`Kokanee`, -`Bull Trout`, -`Rainbow Trout`) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Stream gradient and channel width thresholds used to model potentially highest value fish habitat.&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.1: Stream gradient and channel width thresholds used to model potentially highest value fish habitat.

Crossings surveyed included closed bottom structures (CBS), open bottom structures (OBS) and crossings considered “other” (i.e. fords). Photos were taken at surveyed crossings and when possible included images of the road, crossing inlet, crossing outlet, crossing barrel, channel downstream and channel upstream of the crossing and any other relevant features. The following information was recorded for all surveyed crossings: date of inspection, crossing reference, crew member initials, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, stream name, road name and kilometer, road tenure information, crossing type, crossing subtype, culvert diameter or span for OBS, culvert length or width for OBS. A more detailed “full assessment” was completed for all closed bottom structures and included the following parameters: presence/absence of continuous culvert embedment (yes/no), average depth of embedment, whether or not the culvert bed resembled the native stream bed, presence of and percentage backwatering, fill depth, outlet drop, outlet pool depth, inlet drop, culvert slope, average downstream channel width, stream slope, presence/absence of beaver activity, presence/absence of fish at time of survey, type of valley fill, and a habitat value rating. Habitat value ratings were based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), fish migration patterns, the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation (Table 3.4). For crossings determined to be potential barriers or barriers based on the data (see Barrier Scoring), a culvert fix and recommended diameter/span was proposed. tab_habvalue %&gt;% knitr::kable(caption = &#39;Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011).&#39;, booktabs = T) %&gt;% kableExtra::column_spec(column = 1, width_min = &#39;1.5in&#39;) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling(c(&quot;condensed&quot;), full_width = T, font_size = font_set) Table 3.4: Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011). Habitat Value Fish Habitat Criteria High The presence of high value spawning or rearing habitat (e.g., locations with abundance of suitably sized gravels, deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris) which are critical to the fish population. Medium Important migration corridor. Presence of suitable spawning habitat. Habitat with moderate rearing potential for the fish species present. Low No suitable spawning habitat, and habitat with low rearing potential (e.g., locations without deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris, and with little or no suitably sized spawning gravels for the fish species present). 3.2.1 Barrier Scoring Fish passage potential was determined for each stream crossing identified as a closed bottom structure as per MoE (2011a). The combined scores from five criteria: depth and degree to which the structure is embedded, outlet drop, stream width ratio, culvert slope, and culvert length were used to screen whether each culvert was a likely barrier to some fish species and life stages (Table 3.5, Table 3.6. These criteria were developed based on data obtained from various studies and reflect an estimation for the passage of a juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout (Clarkin et al. 2005 ; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). tab &lt;- as_tibble(t(tab_barrier_scoring)) %&gt;% mutate(V4 = names(tab_barrier_scoring)) %&gt;% select(V4, everything()) %&gt;% janitor::row_to_names(1) %&gt;% ##turn the table sideways mutate(Risk = case_when(Risk == &#39;Value&#39; ~ &#39; Value&#39;, T ~ Risk)) tab %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.5: Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).

Cumlative Score Result 0-14 passable 15-19 potential barrier &gt;20 barrier 3.2.2 Cost Benefit Analysis A cost benefit analysis was conducted for each crossing determined to be a barrier based on an estimate of cost associated with remediation or replacement of the crossing with a structure that facilitates fish passage and the amount of potential habitat that would be made available by remediating fish passage at the site (habitat gain index). 3.2.2.1 Habitat Gain Index The habitat gain index is the quantity of modelled habitat upstream of the subject crossing and represents an estimate of habitat gained with remediation of fish passage at the crossing. For this project, a gradient threshold between accessible and non-accessible habitat was set at 20% (for a minimimum length of 100m) intended to represent the maximum gradient of which the strongest swimmers of anadromous species (steelhead) are likely to be able to migrate upstream. For reporting of Phase 1 - fish passage assessments within the body of this report (Table 3.5), a “total” value of habitat &lt;20% output from bcfishpass was used to estimate the amount of habitat upstream of each crossing less than 20% gradient before a falls of height &gt;5m - as recorded in MoE (2020c) or documented in other bcfishpass online documentation. For Phase 2 - habitat confirmation sites, conservative estimates of the linear quantity of habitat to be potentially gained by fish passage restoration, steelhead rearing maximum gradient threshold (7.4%) was used. To generate areas of habitat upstream, the estimated linear length was multiplied by half the downstream channel width measured (overall triangular channel shape) as part of the fish passage assessment protocol. Although these estimates are not generally conservative, have low accuracy and do not account for upstream stream crossing structures they allow a rough idea of the best candidates for follow up. Potential options to remediate fish passage were selected from MoE (2011a) and included: Removal (RM) - Complete removal of the structure and deactivation of the road. Open Bottom Structure (OBS) - Replacement of the culvert with a bridge or other open bottom structure. Based on consultation with FLNR road crossing engineering experts, for this project we considered bridges as the only viable option for OBS type . Streambed Simulation (SS) - Replacement of the structure with a streambed simulation design culvert. Often achieved by embedding the culvert by 40% or more. Based on consultation with FLNR engineering experts, we considered crossings on streams with a channel width of &lt;2m and a stream gradient of &lt;8% as candidates for replacement with streambed simulations. Additional Substrate Material (EM) - Add additional substrate to the culvert and/or downstream weir to embed culvert and reduce overall velocity/turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop = 0, culvert slope &lt;1.0% and stream width ratio &lt; 1.0. Backwater (BW) - Backwatering of the structure to reduce velocity and turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop &lt; 0.3m, culvert slope &lt;2.0%, stream width ratio &lt; 1.2 and stream profiling indicates it would be effective.. Cost estimates for structure replacement with bridges and embedded culverts were generated based on the channel width, slope of the culvert, depth of fill, road class and road surface type. Road details were sourced from FLNRORD (2020b) and FLNRORD (2020a) through bcfishpass. Interviews with Phil MacDonald, Engineering Specialist FLNR - Kootenay, Steve Page, Area Engineer - FLNR - Northern Engineering Group and Matt Hawkins - MoTi - Design Supervisor for Highway Design and Survey - Nelson were utilized to helped refine estimates. Base costs for installation of bridges on forest service roads and permit roads with surfaces specified in provincial GIS road layers as rough and loose was estimated at $12500/linear m and assumed that the road could be closed during construction and a minimum bridge span of 10m. For streams with channel widths &lt;2m, embedded culverts were reported as an effective solution with total installation costs estimated at $25k/crossing (pers. comm. Phil MacDonald, Steve Page). For larger streams (&gt;6m), span width increased proportionally to the size of the stream (ex. for an 8m wide stream a 12m wide span was prescribed). For crossings with large amounts of fill (&gt;3m), the replacement bridge span was increased by an additional 3m for each 1m of fill &gt;3m to account for cutslopes to the stream at a 1.5:1 ratio. To account for road type, a multiplier table was also generated to estimate incremental cost increases with costs estimated for structure replacement on paved surfaces, railways and arterial/highways costing up to 20 times more than forest service roads due to expenses associate with design/engineering requirements, traffic control and paving. The cost multiplier table (Table 3.7) should be considered very approximate with refinement recommended for future projects. # print_tab_cost_mult(caption_text = &#39;Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.&#39;) tab_cost_rd_mult_report %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.7: Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.

The main objective of the field surveys was to document upstream habitat quantity and quality and to determine if any other obstructions exist above or below the crossing. Habitat value was assessed based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation. Criteria used to rank habitat value was based on guidelines in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2011) (Table 3.4). During habitat confirmations, to standardize data collected and facilitate submission of the data to provincial databases, information was collected on “Site Cards”. Habitat characteristics recorded included channel widths, wetted widths, residual pool depths, gradients, bankfull depths, stage, temperature, conductivity, pH, cover by type, substrate and channel morphology (among others). When possible, the crew surveyed downstream of the crossing to the point where fish presence had been previously confirmed and upstream to a minimum distance of 600m. Any potential obstacles to fish passage were inventoried with photos, physical descriptions and locations recorded on site cards. Surveyed routes were recorded with time-signatures on handheld GPS units. Fish sampling was conducted on a subset of sites when biological data was considered to add significant value to the physical habitat assessment information. When possible, electrofishing was utilized within discrete site units both upstream and downstream of the subject crossing with electrofisher settings, water quality parameters (i.e. conductivity, temperature and ph), start location, length of site and wetted widths (average of a minimum of three) recorded. For each fish captured, fork length and species was recorded, with results included within the fish data submission spreadsheet. Fish information and habitat data will be submitted to the province under scientific fish collection permit CB20-611971. 3.4 Reporting Reporting was generated with bookdown (Xie 2016) from Rmarkdown (Allaire et al. 2023) with primarily R (R Core Team 2022) and SQL scripts. The R package fpr contains many specialized custom functions related to the work (Irvine [2022] 2022). In addition to numerous spatial layers sourced through the BC Data Catalogue then stored and queried in a local postgresql and sqlite databases data inputs for this project include: Populated Fish Data Submission Spreadsheet Template - V 2.0, January 20, 2020 Populated pscis_assessment_template_v24.xls bcfishpass outputs.

Photos and photo metadata Version changes are tracked here and issues/planned enhancements tracked here. 3.5 Mapping Mapping was completed by Hillcrest Geographics. pdf maps were generated using QGIS with data supplied via a postgreSQL database. A QGIS layer file defining and symbolizing all layers required for general fish passage mapping was developed and at the time of reporting was kept under version control within bcfishpass.

The Coffin Creek watershed has been selected as a focus area for Environmental Stewardship Initiative (ESI) sampling research critical flow monitoring, benthic invertebrate sampling and fisheries assessments (pers. comm Don Morgan, Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy). Irvine (2021) assessed crossings located at the downstream end of the stream on Lawson Road and under the CN Railway in 2020 with results presented here. Coffin Lake is a shallow lake (max depth 2m) located approximately 4.5km upstream of Lawson Road. In the late 1980s, Ducks Unlimited raised water levels in Coffin Lake and a downstream wetland area by installing a 63m long by 2.3m high earthen dam incorporating a variable crest weir capable of a 1.0m drawdown. Additionally excavated level ditching (1800m) within the sedge willow meadow was planned.The intent of the works was to provide a more secure and stable water regime, improve water/cover interspersion and provide territorial, loafing and nesting sites for waterfowl (Hatlevik 1985; Simpson 1986; MoE 2020c). Documentation detailing specifics of the final design of the dam was not obtained with a search of available literature. Upstream of dam, longnose sucker, largescale sucker, redside shiner, cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, mountain whitefish, and dolly varden have previously been recorded upstream (Knowledge Management 2022; Norris [2018] 2022). A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table 4.2. The site was assessed on August 31, 2022 with results summarized in Table 4.1. Photos are presented in Figure 4.2. Surveys were conducted with a remotely piloted aircraft upstream and downstream of the dam with resulting images stitched into an orthomosaic and 3-dimensional model presented in Figures 4.3 - 4.4. Wetland habitat was present upstream and downstream of the dam with habitat rated as high value for juvenile coho and lamprey rearing.

A total of 9 Phase 1 assessments at sites not yet inventoried into the PSCIS system included 3 crossings considered “passable”, 0 crossings considered “potential” barriers and 3 crossings considered “barriers” according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length (MoE 2011a). Additionally, although all were considered fully passable, 3 crossings assessed were fords and ranked as “unknown” according to the provincial protocol. Georeferenced field maps are presented here and available for bulk download as Attachment 1. A summary of crossings assessed, a cost estimate for remediation and a priority ranking for follow up for Phase 1 sites is presented in Table 4.3. Detailed data with photos are presented in Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos. “Barrier” and “Potential Barrier” rankings used in this project followed MoE (2011a) and reflect an assessment of passability for juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout at any flows potentially present throughout the year (Clarkin et al. 2005 ; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). As noted in Bourne et al. (2011), with a detailed review of different criteria in Kemp and O’Hanley (2010), passability of barriers can be quantified in many different ways. Fish physiology (i.e. species, length, swim speeds) can make defining passability complex but with important implications for evaluating connectivity and prioritizing remediation candidates (Bourne et al. 2011; Shaw et al. 2016; Mahlum et al. 2014; Kemp and O’Hanley 2010). Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife (2009) present criteria for assigning passability scores to culverts that have already been assessed as barriers in coarser level assessments. These passability scores provide additional information to feed into decision making processes related to the prioritization of remediation site candidates and have potential for application in British Columbia. tab_cost_est_phase1 %&gt;% select(`PSCIS ID`:`Cost Est ( $K)`) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Upstream habitat estimates and cost benefit analysis for Phase 1 assessments conducted on sites not yet inventoried in PSCIS.

A total of approximately 7km of stream was assessed, fish sampling utilizing electrofishing surveys were conducted at one stream. Georeferenced field maps are presented in here and available for bulk download as Attachment 1. As collaborative decision making was ongoing at the time of reporting, site prioritization can be considered preliminary. In total, Three crossings were rated as high priorities for proceeding to design for replacement, 4 crossings were rated as moderate priorities, and 0 crossings were rated as low priorities. Results are summarized in Figure 4.1 and Tables 4.4 - 4.7 with raw habitat and fish sampling data included in digital format as Attachment 3.

Designs for McDowell and Robert Hatch were procured by SERNbc and Canadian Wildlife Federation respectively. At the time of reporting, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, in collaboration with Canadian Wildlife Federation was in the process of procuring designs for remediation of fish passage at three sites documented in Irvine (2021) including PSCIS 123445 on Tyhee Creek, PSCIS 124500 on Helps Creek and PSCIS 197640 on a tributary to Buck Creek. Additionally, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure were procuring a design for PSCIS crossing 124420 on Station Creek (also know as Mission Creek) near New Hazleton (pers. comm. Sean Wong, Environmental Programs, MoTi). "],["recommendations.html", "5 Recommendations", " 5 Recommendations Recommendations for potential incorporation into collaborative watershed connectivity planning include: Continue to acquire background information and leverage ongoing research initiatives in the region to collaboratively clarify current conditions and identify limiting factors to inform prioritization and effectiveness monitoring programs. Develop strategies to explore cost and fisheries production benefits of stream crossing structure upgrades alongside alternative/additional restoration and enhancement investments such as land conservation/procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management, water treatment and research. Ideentify and pursue opportunities to collaborate and leverage initiatives together in study area watersheds (ex. fish passage rehabilitation, riparian restoration and cattle exclusion) for maximum likely restoration benefits. Refine barrier thresholds for road-stream crossing structures to explore metrics specific to life stage and life history types of species of interest. This will further focus efforts of potential remediation actions based on biological attributes (ex. timing of migration, size/direction of fish migrating, population dynamics, etc.) and could result in the consideration of interim “stop-gap” physical works to alter crossing characteristics that can address key connectivity issues yet be significantly less costly than structure replacements (ex. building up of downstream area with rock riffles to decrease the outlet drop size and/or increasing water depth within pipe with baffles and substrate additions). Model fish densities (fish/m2) vs. habitat/water quality characteristics (i.e. gradient, discharge, alkalinity, elevation, riparian health, distance from high order streams, etc.) using historically gathered electrofishing and remotely sensed geodata to inform crossing prioritization, future data acquisition needs and the monitoring of restoration actions. Continue to develop bcfishpass,bcfishobs, fwapg, bcdata and fpr as well as to share open source data analysis and presentation tools that are scaleable and facilitate continual improvement. Tools should continue to be flexible and well documented to allow the future incorporation of alternative fragmentation indicators, habitat gain/value metrics and watershed sensitivity indicators.

The site is located on Barrett Station Road, approximately 2.5km upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River. PSCIS crossing 195944 is located on Highway 16, approximately 850m upstream of crossing 195943. Both crossings are the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Background At crossing 195943, Stock Creek is a third order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 14.3km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1274m to 636m at the crossing (Table 5.1). Although coho and chinook salmon have been observed just downstream of the railway crossing in the past, there is no fisheries information within provincial databases for the areas upstream of crossings 195943 and 195944 (Knowledge Management 2022; Norris [2018] 2022). At the time of reporting, Harry Bell owned land adjacent to the creek near the highway and Barrett Station Road. He reported historical sightings of adult coho and steelhead upstream of Barrett Station Road.

The purpose of the work is to reduce fuel load on crown/agricultural land interface and enhance grazing land through targeted grazing and/or through the manual removal of dead standing timber and coarse woody debris. At the time of reporting, Stock Creek, upstream of the assessed Highway 16 crossing, was included within the project area and Dogwood Environmental Consulting noted that they hoped to help range holders mitigate some of the potential impacts related to fuel reduction opening up access to streams by exploring opportunities to prevent cattle from accessing riparian buffers (pers. comm Jenn Atkins, 2022). # PSCIS stream crossings 195943 and 195944 were ranked as high priorities for follow up by Canadian Wildlife Federation due to significant amounts of habitat modelled as upstream of the crossing. Following a review of PSCIS database and modelling outputs Irvine (2018) ranked both crossings as moderate priorities for follow up with habitat confirmations with notes that the stream appeared to be dewatered at both locations in the PSCIS database photos and because the watershed was relatively low in elevation. A total of 11ha of lake and 21ha of wetland is modelled upstream and a summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table 5.2.

Total cover amount was rated as abundant with boulders dominant. Cover was also present as undercut banks.The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders sub-dominant.The average channel width was 3.1m, the average wetted width was 1.8m, and the average gradient was 2.1%. Good flow volumes were noted along with a decent amount of complexity due to boulders and undercut banks. There were small pockets of gravel suitable for resident rainbow as well as coho and steelhead spawning. The channel appeared to be constricted with riparian vegetation removed on both sides of the stream, likely due to agricultural development. Irrigation pipes in the channel indicated water withdrawal was occurring. The habitat was rated as medium value as an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential for juvenile coho, steelhead and other salmonids. The stream was surveyed downstream from crossing 195944 for 300m. Total cover amount was rated as trace with boulders dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders sub-dominant.The average channel width was 4.1m, the average wetted width was 1.5m, and the average gradient was 3.2%. There were many undercut banks throughout, with fish up to 20cm long sighted throughout covered areas. There was a cattle trail next to the stream, with significan areas of streambank impacted by erosion. Minimal quantities of gravel suitable for spawning were observed. Although riparian vegetation in the upper portions of the area surveyed habitat was rated as medium value as an with occasional pockets of habitat suitable for resident/anadromous salmonid spawning and moderate rearing potential for juvenile salmonids. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 195944 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 195944 for 640m (Figure 5.5). The dominant substrate was boulders with cobbles sub-dominant.The average channel width was 4.2m, the average wetted width was 1.8m, and the average gradient was 2%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with boulders dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and undercut banks. Within the areas surveyed, the stream was noted as heavily impacted by cattle activity with significant amounts of manure in the stream, degraded/removed riparian vegetation and extensive areas of trampled banks. There were occasional pockets of gravel suitable for resident rainbow spawning. Field notes indicate, occasional pools with depths suitable for juvenile salmon and adult resident salmonid overwintering. A rock drop of 65cm was located 365m upstream of the top end of the culvert (Figure 5.6). This drop would likely be passable for adult salmonids but dependent on flow conditions, could prevent upstream migration for for younger life stages of anadromous fish as well as non-adult resident species. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Replacement of PSCIS crossing 195943 with a bridge (10m span) is recommended. The cost of the work was estimated at $2,000,000 for a cost benefit of 0.4 linear m/$1000 and 0.6 m2/$1000. Replacement of PSCIS crossing 195944 with a bridge (10m span) will have significant costs ($1,500,000) due to the length of the structure and depth of fill. A cost benefit is estimated 0.1 linear m/$1000 and 0.1 m2/$1000. Conclusion Crossing 195943 was ranked as a high priority for proceeding to design for replacement with a bridge with 0.7km of habitat present upstream before the highway 16 crossing rated as medium value for resident rainbow, coho and steelhead rearing and spawning. Crossing 195944 was ranked as a high priority for proceeding to design for replacement with a bridge with 7.2km of habitat modelled as present upstream. Heavily impacted by range use, the habitat surveyed upstream of this culvert was rated as medium value. At the time of assessment, Stock Creek was heavily impacted by land clearing and cattle throughout all areas surveyed due to trampled banks and grazed or removed riparian vegetation. It is encouraging that range holders, the province and consultants (ie. Dogwood Environmental Consulting) hope to mitigate some of the potential impacts related to fuel reduction work ongoing at the time of reporting by exploring opportunities to prevent cattle from accessing riparian buffers. It is recommended that an overall plan also be developed to restore the riparian areas and further mitigate range use impacts on stream health. Historic information from the site indicate that flows can be minimal during dry periods. An analysis of land cover and water withdrawal for the greater watershed could provide valuable information as to inform restoration planning such as potentially reversible land use impacts that may exacerbate drought (ex. historic wetland drainage, multiple points of water diversion, vegetation removal, etc). Historical sightings of adult coho and steelhead upstream of Barrett Station Road by the landowner adjacent to crossing 195943 indicate that the stream was historically suitable for these species and the lower reaches’ location near the Bulkley River mainsten position it for likely utilization by numerous fish species when flows are adequate. These insights and the large size of the outlet drop from the pipe under Barrett Station Road position this site as A good candidate for fish passage restoration. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site | Site == my_site2) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39; and &#39;, my_site2, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.6: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 195943 and 195944.

Byman Creek habitat and road stream crossing structures were assessed in 2020 with background and results presented in Irvine (2021). Three stream crossing structures are located downstream of Perow Loop road and are discussed below. Although modelling indicates seven crossings are located upstream of crossing 197653, review of GIS data indicates six of those crossings are located on small tributary streams over 7km upstream and very unlikely to provide high value habitat. The upstream crossing on the transmission line ~350m from Perow Loop road was assessed and is discussed below. Crossing 197653 is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Background At crossing 197653, Perow Creek is a fourth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 16.4km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1412m to 810m near the crossing (Table 5.7). Although chinook, coho and steelhead have been observed downstream in Byman Creek within ~100m of the crossing, at the time of reporting, there was no fisheries information available for the area upstream of crossing 197653 (MoE 2020b; Norris 2020). fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), footnote_text = &#39;Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the upstream watershed area is above&#39;, scroll = F) Table 5.7: Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing 197653.

Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing 197653 was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011b) (Table 5.9). The culvert outlet drop measured at 0.3m high. There were large chunks of concrete just downstream of the outlet armouring the banks. There was no water at the time of survey. fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo() Table 5.9: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 197653.

The entire area assessed downstream of the crossing was dry at the time of the survey (Figures 5.7 - 5.8). Total cover amount was rated as moderate with boulders dominant. Cover was also present as overhanging vegetation. The average channel width was 4.3m, and the average gradient was 2%. The dominant substrate was boulders with cobbles sub-dominant. PSCIS crossing 197657 on the highway, approximately 50m downstream from crossing 197653 was reassessed and ranked as passable as it was low gradient, fully embedded and with no outlet drop. It appeared passable to all species and life stages at the time of assessment (Table 5.10). This crossing was previously assessed in 2020 by Irvine (2021), but it was mistakenly input as modelled crossing ID 1800064, when it should have been 1800067. The stream from Perow Loop Road to the highway flowed through private property and appeared to be channelized and confined with concrete slabs used as stream bank armoring just downstream of the outlet. Downstream of the highway crossing two bridges are documented in the PSCIS database (197660 and 197659). Although habitat downstream had limited complexity resulting from impacts related to the adjacent road infrastructure and residential properties, the habitat was rated as medium value as it was considered an important migration corridor. fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo(dat = pscis_reassessments, site = my_site2, site_photo_id = my_site2) Table 5.10: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 197657.

Comments: Stream was dry at the time of survey but had water last year during extremely dry ear. Culvert appears passable for all life stages. There is a private land residential development impacting the stream. The channel is constricted and has large chunks of riprap throughout. 10:45 Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 197653 for 500m (Figures 5.9 - 5.12). Two sections of stream upstream of the crossing were assessed. As residential buildings and yards were situated immediately adjacent to the stream upstream of the crossing, the stream was accessed from a ford located on the transmission line ~325m upstream of Perow Loop Road. The first section surveyed included ~350m of channel upstream of the ford and was dewatered at the time of survey. Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris.The average channel width was 3.2m, the average wetted width was 1.9m, and the average gradient was 3%.The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant. Habitat quality improved significantly within the second section of stream surveyed where flows were significant. Water temperature was 13\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 8.1 and conductivity was 230uS/cm. The average channel width was 4.7m, the average wetted width was 2.4m, and the average gradient was 3.7%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with boulders dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant. There were gravels present throughout the area surveyed that were suitable for resident and anadromous salmonid spawning. Infrequent deep pools for salmonids rearing and overwintering were also present. Overall, the habitat was rated as medium value as an important migration corridor containing pockets of habitat suitable for spawning with moderate potential for juvenile salmonid rearing. fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo(dat = pscis_phase1, site = 1801071, site_photo_id = 1801071, col_filter = my_crossing_reference) Table 5.11: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 1801071.

The cost of the work is estimated at $400,000 for a cost benefit of 0.8 linear m/$1000 and 1.8 m2/$1000. Conclusion There was 7.4km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing 197653 with areas surveyed rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing 197653 was ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Perow Creek near crossing 197653 has been negatively impacted by adjacent land use related to landscaping of private residences. Impacts include riparian vegetation removal, channelization, and streambank armouring. As there is no historic information on fish presence upstream of the highway fish sampling is recommended. Regardless of whether structure replacement proceeds, local residents should be engaged to explore options for riparian and channel rehabilitation on private lands within the lower reaches. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.12: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 197653.

The highway is 0.4km upstream from the confluence with the Ailport Creek and the crossing is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Background At crossing 197974, Watson Creek is a third order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 17.9km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1415m to 771m near the crossing (Table 5.13). Upstream of the highway coho salmon and rainbow trout have previously been recorded with the coho observation date documented as September 2000 (MoE 2020b; Norris 2020). PSCIS crossing 198065 is located ~2.5km upstream of the highway on Montgomery Road, was assessed in 2021 and was ranked as a barrier to fish passage according to the provincial protocol. Farther upstream, there are two addition sites where GIS modelling indicates road stream crossings may be present (modelled crossing IDs 1801123 and 1801115). Watson Creek flows through Buckrow Angus farm immediately upstream of the highway then into Ailport Creek approximately 350m downstream.

The culvert was considered a complete barrier to all species and all life stages at all flows due to an outlet drop measured at 1m high.

The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant.The average channel width was 3.5m, the average wetted width was 1.4m, and the average gradient was 2.2%.Total cover amount was rated as trace with small woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as undercut banks and deep pools. Immediately downstream of the culvert stream flows were noted as very minimal however, at approximately 50m downstream the volume of water increased substantially. There were occasional deep pools and undercut banks but cover and complexity was notably lacking in most areas. At approximately 100m downstream of the highway riparian forests have been removed to accommodate pasture with notably less cover present and a channel confined by steep banks. Abundant gravels suitable for resident and anadromous salmonid spawning were present throughout the area surveyed. The habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 197974 for 600m (Figures 5.15 - 5.18). The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation.The average channel width was 3.4m, the average wetted width was 1.8m, and the average gradient was 1.8%. Numerous salmonid fry were noted throughout the area surveyed along with abundant gravels suitable for resident and anadromous salmonid spawning. Immediately upstream of the crossing for approximately 150-200m stream banks and riparian areas were heavily impacted by cattle with beaver activity also noted in this area. Some pools to 0.7m deep were present and suitable for salmonid juvenile rearing and overwintering. Survey notes indicate that at the time of the survey cattle appeared to be accessing the stream intermittently throughout the entire area surveyed. Overall, the habitat surveyed upstream of the crossing rated as medium value as an important migration corridor containing habitat suitable for rainbow and coho spawning with moderate rearing potential for juvenile salmonids. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 197974 with a bridge (10m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $1,500,000 for a cost benefit of 1.6 linear m/$1000 and 2.8 m2/$1000. Conclusion Modelling indicates 13.9km of habitat upstream of crossing 197974 suitable for steelhead rearing with areas surveyed rated as medium value for rearing and spawning. Crossing 197974 was ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Capture of coho upstream of the highway in 2000 is an indication that the watershed has provided habitat for anadromous species in the past. Although the culvert under the highway appears to be a complete barrier to all species and life stages of fish at all flows, fish sampling in this area would help confirm that anadromous fish are no longer able to ascend the culvert. This seems likely so it would be necessary to replace the highway crossing for anadromous fish to populate the watershed upstream. Subsequently the highway crossing should be replaced first, before pursueing remedial works at the culvert located 2.5km upstream on Montgomery Road. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.16: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 197974.

In reality, the stream flows from an area south of town, through New Hazelton in a northern direction crossing under numerous road crossings and two CN railway crossings before joining with Waterfall Creek approximately 1.6km above where it joins Station Creek (Figure 5.19). Due to the large size of the stream in the areas surveyed and the small stream size of Waterfall Creek documented in PSCIS at crossing 124456 we suspect that our subject stream should potentially have been labelled Waterfall Creek in the freshwater atlas as it appears to contain the bulk of the flow in the watershed. During 2022 field surveys, three previously un-assessed stream crossings located upstream of the upper most railway culverts (PSCIS 124423) were surveyed for fish passage (PSCIS 198117 on 9th avenue, 198116 on Highway 16/10th avenue and 198115 on 13th avenue). Downstream of these three crossings the stream flows through six more road/rail crossings before it’s confluence with Station Creek. A small bridge (modelled crossing 24704553 - a.k.a Mile 48) is located under the CN Railway approximately 875m upstream of the highway and at the time of reporting, there was an un-assessed crossing (1803294) on the subject tributary just upstream of it’s confluence with Waterfall Creek. Site surveys downstream in Waterfall Creek in 2021 along with review of aerial imagery indicate that modelled crossing 1803294 likely does not exist as the stream appears to run adjacent to the railway at this location and not cross the road. The location of modeled crossing 1803294 would need to be accessed from the west by crossing the CN Railway or from the east via a private road located behind gates to the New Hazelton sewage treatment facility. Although the habitat confirmation assessment in this memo is detailed as for crossing 198116, the assessment conducted also covered areas downstream of 198117 and upstream of crossing 198115 so has significance for informing remediation of those culverts as well. The crossing locations were prioritized for follow up after field reconnaissance indicated that Tributary to Waterfall Creek was mapped incorrectly in the BC Freshwater Atlas stream network and likely contained significant quantities of high value habitat for coho spawning and rearing. As the subject tributary to Waterfall Creek was not mapped in the freshwater atlas at the location of these crossings at the time of reporting, there were no road stream crossings modeled as present in bcfishpass. As there were no crossings modeled, the software generated no estimates of fish habitat quantity. PSCIS crossing 198117 is located on , just downstream of 198116. PSCIS crossing 198115 is located on , approximately 370m upstream of 198116. Crossing 198116 on Hiighway 16/10th avenue is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure while crossings 198117 and 198115 are the responsibility of the District of New Hazelton. my_caption = &#39;Map of Station Creek and Watershed Creek watersheds.

Pink line indicates sections of tributary to Waterfall Creek that were surveyed and that at the time of reporting were not mapped correctly in the freshwater atlas. Background In 2021, fish passage and habitat confirmation assessments were conducted on Waterfall Creek downstream of the upper railway crossing (PSCIS 124423) as well as on Station Creek at Highway 16 (PSCIS 124420). Details of these assessments can be referenced in Irvine (2022). Wilson and Rabnett (2007) report that the crossing structure located on Highway 16 and Station Creek (PSCIS 124420) has been the subject of numerous assessments and designs with respect to the rehabilitation of fish passage, and they rated this crossing as the highest priority for rehabilitation in the Bulkley River watershed. Gitxsan Watershed Authority reports that Xsan Xsagiibil was a fishing site located at the mouth of Station Creek (Xsi Gwin Sagiiblax) (Wilson and Rabnett 2007). Identified as a high priority for additional assessments by Rabnett and Williams (2004), SKR Consultants Ltd. (2006) conducted a detailed inspection, offered rehabilitation design options and identified the natural limits of potential fish distribution to support rehabilitation efforts. At the time of reporting, a design for remediation utilizing a retrofit of the existing structure to backwater the pipe was being drafted (Sean Wong, Environmental Programs Manager - Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure pers. comm.). A trap and truck operation led by the Chicago Creek Community Environmental Enhancement Society moves coho from a fence set up near the confluence with the Bulkley River to upstream of Highway 16 on Waterfall Creek annually. Houlden, Houlden, and Donas (2001) report that the coho stocks in the system were wiped out in the late 1970s by the improper installation of PSCIS crossing 124420 located on Highway 16 west of New Hazelton. The Waterfall Creek Stream Rehabilitation Project began in 1990 to reintroduce coho to the stream with surplus stocks transplanted from Toboggan Creek near Smithers. In 1993 the Hazelton Elementary Streamkeepers program was developed to assist with the project and in 1995 the Chicago Creek Community Environmental Enhancement Society was incorporated to develop a hatchery nearby. The hatchery no longer operates but operations were considered successful with coho runs between 65 to over 1800 fish documented between 1998 - 2020 Donas (2022a). There is a rich history of past assessment and restoration work in the watershed that is summarized in Donas (2022a). Work has included stream/habitat surveys, construction of spawning pads, riparian planting, construction of walkways/bridges and juvenile assessments (Donas 2022a; Nortec Consulting 2000). Donas (2022a) is a watershed recovery plan for the greater Station Creek watershed that was submitted to Fisheries and Oceans Canada in March of 2022. The report details coho escapement information for 2002 - 2021 gathered from the “Mission Creek” fence noting numbers have fallen below the target of 400 in 10 out of 20 years. They summarize juvenile overwintering study results indicate a decline in catch per unit effort over the last 10 years with condition of juveniles noted as declining. The document lays out a list of threats affecting coho recovery in the system which among others include connectivity, habitat degradation, loss of riparian cover, beaver dam removals and potential water quality issues. Finally, the recovery plan lays out goals, objectives and recommended activities to stop and reverse the decline of coho in the watershed. At crossing 198116, Tributary to Waterfall Creek is a second order stream. Upstream of crossing 198116, coho, cutthroat trout, rainbow trout and dolly varden have previously been recorded (Donas 2022a; MoE 2020b; Norris 2020). A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment 093M.107. Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing 198116 was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011b) (Table 5.17).

Comments: This is waterfall Creek. It does not show up in the freshwater atlas as here, however this is the main flow. Numerous fry and parr observed upstream of the crossing. No paper card for site. 16:03 Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 198116 with a bridge (10m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $7,500,000 for a cost benefit of NA linear m/$1000 and NA m2/$1000. Conclusion The Waterfall Creek system is part of the greater Station/Mission Creek watershed and located directly in the community of New Hazelton. Although heavily impacted by urban and industrial development, this watershed provides valuable opportunities for public interaction with aquatic values and high potential for meaningful ecosystem function improvements. There is a long history of community led research, restoration and rehabilitation projects within the community which is likley to continue into the future through initiatives described in Donas (2022a). Although upstream migration of adult coho is unlikely to be hindered by the three crossings surveyed, conditions could degrade over time and passage through the structures by younger lifestages salmonids is likley already be prevented at some flows. Ongoing research, monitoring and advocy efforts by groups such as the Chicago Cr Community Environmental Enhancement Society, Skeena Watershed Conservation Coalition and the Gitskan Watershed Authorities indicate that biological conditions in the stream have been worsening overtime. There was 1.2km of habitat upstream of crossing 198116 rated ashighvalue for salmonid rearing and spawning with all three crossings considered high priorities for proceeding to design for replacement. A further recommendation is that infrastructure upgrade dollars for the efforts also be leveraged towards alternative restoration activities such as riparian restoration, public education and research. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.20: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 198116.

The site is located on Walcott Road. Crossing 57793 was located 1.9km upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River. Crossing 57793 is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Background At crossing 57793, Vallee Creek is a third order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 21.7km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1370m to 646m near the crossing (Table 5.21). Upstream of crossing 57793, longnose sucker, cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, and coastrange sculpin (formerly aleutian sculpin) have previously been recorded (MoE 2020b; Norris 2020). fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), footnote_text = &#39;Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above&#39;, scroll = F) Table 5.21: Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing 57793.

A local landowner reported that this crossing does not exist. Review of GIS indicates there is a modelled crossing (ID 1800041) located on the mainstem approximately 5.5km upstream of 57793, on Vallee Creek Road. Additionally, there are several modelled crossings upstream of subject site 57793, located on tributaries that are likely very small. A total of 29ha of lake and 59ha of wetland is modelled upstream. These lakes include Vallee Lake(10ha), Helen Lake(16ha) and other small unnamed lakes that are of insignificant size. Upstream of crossing 1800041, the mainstem drains into Vallee Lake before flowing through the culvert (PSCIS crossing 57801) located on Highway 16. This crossing was listed as a barrier at the time of survey by Gollner, Cain, and Russell (2013) in 2012. Comments indicate that fish were observed downstream, and good habitat was present upstream. Vallee Creek then flows east past the highway through PSCIS crossings 57786, followed by 57787, before draining into Helen Lake. PSCIS stream crossing 57793 was ranked as a high priority for follow up by the Canadian Wildlife Federation due to significant amounts of habitat modeled upstream. Irvine (2018) ranked the site as a moderate priority for follow up after review of PSCIS data/photos because the site appeared to have low flows, be partially backwatered and have no outlet drop indicating it was likely passable to most species and life stages at the time the initial fish passage assessment was conducted by Gollner, Cain, and Russell (2013) in 2012.

Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing 57793 was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011b) (Table 5.23). There was low flow through the culvert at the time of survey. However, a deep outlet pool was present indicating high flows do occur and that the culvert may be undersized.

Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant.The average channel width was 4.1m, the average wetted width was 2.4m, and the average gradient was 2%. There were undercut banks and abundant riparian vegetation throughout providing good cover for fish. Some gravels were present that could be suitable for spawning. Functional large woody debris was present throughout the stream.The habitat was rated as high value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 57793 for 600m (Figures 5.30 - 5.33). The average channel width was 4.1m, the average wetted width was 2m, and the average gradient was 2%.The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation. The data for the upstream survey was misplaced and stream characteristics and measurements were obtained by reviewing photos. The habitat quality was excellent. There were abundant undercut banks and healthy mixed riparian vegetation throughout. The stream was wide and contained some pockets of gravel suitable for spawning resident species. The habitat was rated as high value as an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 57793 with a bridge (10m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $2,000,000 for a cost benefit of 8 linear m/$1000 and 18.8 m2/$1000. Conclusion There was 3.4km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing 57793 with areas surveyed rated as high value for salmonid rearing and spawning. As the culvert outlet drop was small, and because the relatively low elevation of the watershed may result in low flows in typical years (see assessment photos from Gollner, Cain, and Russell (2013) here), 57793 was ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Electrofishing upstream and downstream of the culvert is recommended to provide insight into fish community composition and density which may justify a higher priority for site remediation. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.24: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 57793.

Crossing 58067 was located 2.6km upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Background At crossing 58067, Gramophone Creek is a fourth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 33.3km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1480m to 459m at the crossing (Table 5.25). Upstream of crossing 58067, rainbow trout and steelhead have previously been recorded (MoE 2020b; Norris 2020). fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %&gt;% select(-&#39;Elev Min&#39;) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), footnote_text = &#39;Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above&#39;, scroll = F) Table 5.25: Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing 58067.

Fisheries Sensitive Watersheds have significant fish values and are sensitive to changes in habitat (M. Porter et al. 2015). The Trout Creek/Moricetown watershed project was an integrated restoration plan designed for 14 watersheds found on either side of the Bulkley River. Gramophone Creek was included in the study area. A level I sediment source assessment was conducted on the watershed. This provided an overview and a risk assessment of sedimentation in pre defined study blocks, which was then used to recommend further restoration strategies. The risk assessment was used to determine if the roads were on low, moderate, or high-risk terrain; and the consequence that sedimentation could have on the road’s associated fisheries stream. Gramophone Creek scored lower than average overall on the risk assessment but had some study blocks that required a level II assessment (Sterling Wood Group Inc. 1997). In a study conducted by (M. Porter et al. 2015), the Gramophone Creek stream network was analysed using GIS methods to assess the risk status related to fish habitat impact. Risk status was determined by measuring nine habitat indicators. These included: road density for the entire watershed, road density above the H60 line (the elevation above which 60% of the watershed area lies), road density less than 100m from a stream, stream crossing density, proportion of stream logged, proportion of fish-bearing stream logged, density of stream banks logged on slopes greater than 60%, peak flow index, and road density on unstable slopes. Measured values were compared to a baseline to classify risk as low, moderate, or high. Of the 71 watersheds included in the analysis, Gramophone Creek was notable for having all nine indicators rated as high risk. PSCIS stream crossing 58067 was ranked as a high priority for follow up by the Canadian Wildlife Federation because of significant amounts of habitat modelled upstream of the crossing. Upon review of an assessment done on this crossing in 2012 by Gollner, Cain, and Russell (2013), Irvine (2018) ranked it as a high priority for follow up due to its high habitat value. A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table 5.26. A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment 093L.122. fpr::fpr_table_bcfp(scroll = gitbook_on) Table 5.26: Summary of fish habitat modelling for PSCIS crossing 58067.

Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing 58067 was un-embedded, non-backwatered, had an outlet drop of 0.49m and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011b) (Table 5.27). The crossing consisted of two pipes, with a very big outlet pool indicating the crossing was undersized. The pipes were notes as in poor condition due to corrosion and the road prism at the site had indications of significant erosion adjacent to the crossing. Water temperature was 12\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 8.2 and conductivity was 93uS/cm. fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo() Table 5.27: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 58067.

Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, boulders, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation.The average channel width was 5.1m, the average wetted width was 3m, and the average gradient was 3%.The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders sub-dominant. There were abundant undercut banks available for cover. Some patches of gravel were present that would be suitable for rainbow, steelhead and coho spawning. Occasional deep pools were present that would serve as good habitat suitable for fish rearing and overwintering. Riparian vegetation was mixed decidous and conifer old growth forest. The habitat was rated as high value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 58067 for 600m (Figures 5.37 - 5.40). The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant.The average channel width was 5.7m, the average wetted width was 4m, and the average gradient was 3%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with boulders dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and undercut banks. There is a small beaver dam ~500m upstream from the crossing. The stream is wide throughout with abundant cover and some areas with gravels suitable for spawning. There is approximately 50m of open residential area on the right bank. The habitat was rated as high value as an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential. Fish Sampling Electrofishing was conducted with results summarised in Tables 5.29 - 5.30 and Figure 5.34. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing 58067 with a bridge (11.5m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $1,150,000 for a cost benefit of 12.2 linear m/$1000 and 40.2 m2/$1000. Conclusion There was 3.4km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing 58067 with areas surveyed rated as high value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Gramophone Creek is a large system with habitat suitable for numerous species including coho salmon and steelhead. The crossings location adjacent to the community of Witset, BC is ideal for community involvement in the project. Additionally, because Telkwa high road is a non-paved road with a crossing location that can be accessed from either side, the costs of the work are low when compared to paved road and highway options. Crossing 58067 was ranked as a high priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Elecrofishing results at the site indicated that the stream is productive in terms of rainbow trout however the lack of coho presence was surprising. It is recommended that the stream be surveyed all the way down to the Bulkley River to confirm that there are no barriers to migration downstream of the crossing before remedial works are planned. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.28: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 58067.
