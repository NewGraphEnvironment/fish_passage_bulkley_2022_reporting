## Dam Assessment
One dam on Coffin Creek - Canadian Aquatic Barrier Database and `bcfishpass` `dam_id` 1f365462-063c-491e-9fb3-bfac004d9183 - was assessed for fish passage [@canadianwildlifefederation2023CanadianAquatic].  The Coffin Creek watershed has been selected as a focus area for Environmental Stewardship Initiative (ESI) sampling research critical flow monitoring, benthic invertebrate sampling and fisheries assessments (pers. comm Don Morgan, Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy). @irvine2021BulkleyRiver assessed crossings located at the downstream end of the stream on Lawson Road and under the CN Railway in 2020 with results presented [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_bulkley_2020_reporting/appendix-197668-124504-coffin-creek.html).  

<br>

Coffin Lake is a shallow lake (max depth 2m) located approximately 4.5km upstream of Lawson Road.  In the late 1980s, Ducks Unlimited raised water levels in Coffin Lake and a downstream wetland area by installing a 63m long by 2.3m high earthen dam incorporating a variable crest weir capable of a 1.0m drawdown.  Additionally excavated level ditching (1800m) within the sedge willow meadow was planned.The intent of the works was to provide a more secure and stable water regime, improve water/cover interspersion and provide territorial, loafing and nesting sites for waterfowl [@hatlevik1985ReconnaissanceSurvey; @simpson1986DucksUnlimited; @ProvincialObstaclesFish]. Documentation detailing specifics of the final design of the dam was not obtained with a search of available literature. 

<br>

Upstream of dam, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp(site = '1f365462-063c-491e-9fb3-bfac004d9183', col_filter = dam_id)` have previously been recorded upstream [@knowledgemanagement2022KnownBC; @norris2022smnorrisbcfishobs]. A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table \@ref(tab:tab-dam-bcfp).

<br>

The site was assessed on August 31, 2022 with results summarized in Table \@ref(tab:tab-dams). Photos are presented in Figure \@ref(fig:photo-dams-01). Surveys were conducted with a remotely piloted aircraft upstream and downstream of the dam with resulting images stitched into an orthomosaic and 3-dimensional model `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output(" presented in Figures \\@ref(fig:ortho-caption-coffin) - \\@ref(fig:model-caption-coffin).")} else knitr::asis_output("presented [here](https://www.mapsmadeeasy.com/maps/public/fe773f4deef84939b04f5e941e35506a) and [here](https://www.mapsmadeeasy.com/maps/public_3D/fe773f4deef84939b04f5e941e35506a).")` Wetland habitat was present upstream and downstream of the dam with habitat rated as high value for juvenile coho and lamprey rearing.  A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(site = '1f365462-063c-491e-9fb3-bfac004d9183', col_filter = dam_id, col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet(site = '1f365462-063c-491e-9fb3-bfac004d9183')`).

## Phase 1

Field assessments were conducted between `r format(min(pscis_phase1$date), format="%B %d %Y")` and `r format(max(pscis_phase1$date), format="%B %d %Y")` by Allan Irvine, R.P.Bio. and Mateo Winterscheidt, B.Sc., Tieasha Pierre, Vern Joseph, Dallas Nikal, Alexandria Nikal, Jesse Olson and Colin Morrison. A total of `r n_distinct(pscis_phase1$my_crossing_reference)` Phase 1 assessments at sites not yet inventoried into the PSCIS system included `r pscis_phase1 %>% filter(barrier_result == 'Passable') %>% nrow()` crossings considered "passable", `r pscis_phase1 %>% filter(barrier_result == 'Potential') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english()` crossings considered "potential" barriers and `r pscis_phase1 %>% filter(barrier_result == 'Barrier') %>% nrow()` crossings considered "barriers" according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length [@fish_passage_assessments]. Additionally, although all were considered fully passable, `r pscis_phase1 %>% filter(barrier_result == 'Unknown') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english()` crossings assessed were fords and ranked as "unknown" according to the provincial protocol. Georeferenced field maps are presented  `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("[here](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/bulkley/archive/2022-05-02/) and available for bulk download as [Attachment 1](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/bulkley/archive/2022-05-02/bulkley_2022-05-02.zip).")} else knitr::asis_output("in [Attachment 1](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/bulkley/archive/2022-05-02/bulkley_2022-05-02.zip).")` A summary of crossings assessed, a cost estimate for remediation and a priority ranking for follow up for Phase 1 sites is presented in Table \@ref(tab:cost-est-phase-1). Detailed data with photos are presented in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("[Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos]")} else knitr::asis_output("[Attachment 2](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_bulkley_2022_reporting/appendix---phase-1-fish-passage-assessment-data-and-photos.html")`.


<br>

"Barrier" and "Potential Barrier" rankings used in this project followed @fish_passage_assessments and reflect an assessment of passability for juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout at any flows potentially present throughout the year [@clarkinNationalInventoryAssessment2005 ;@bellFisheriesHandbookEngineering1991; @thompsonAssessingFishPassage2013]. As noted in @bourne_etal2011Barriersfish, with a detailed review of different criteria in @kemp_ohanley2010Proceduresevaluating, passability of barriers can be quantified in many different ways. Fish physiology (i.e. species, length, swim speeds) can make defining passability complex but with important implications for evaluating connectivity and prioritizing remediation candidates [@bourne_etal2011Barriersfish; @shaw_etal2016Importancepartial; @mahlum_etal2014EvaluatingBarrier; @kemp_ohanley2010Proceduresevaluating].  @washingtondepartmentoffishwildlife2009FishPassage present criteria for assigning passability scores to culverts that have already been assessed as barriers in coarser level assessments. These passability scores provide additional information to feed into decision making processes related to the prioritization of remediation site candidates and have potential for application in British Columbia.

```

<br>

## Phase 2
During 2022 field assessments, habitat confirmation assessments were conducted at `r hab_site_priorities %>% nrow()` sites in the Bulkley River watershed.  A total of approximately `r habitat_confirmations_priorities %>% pull(length_surveyed) %>% sum(na.rm = T) %>% round(-3)/1000`km of stream was assessed, fish sampling utilizing electrofishing surveys were conducted at one stream. Georeferenced field maps are presented in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("[here](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/bulkley/archive/2022-05-02/) and available for bulk download as [Attachment 1](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/bulkley/archive/2022-05-02/bulkley_2022-05-02.zip).")} else knitr::asis_output("[Attachment 1](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/bulkley/archive/2022-05-02/bulkley_2022-05-02.zip).")`

<br>

As collaborative decision making was ongoing at the time of reporting, site prioritization can be considered preliminary.  In total, `r hab_site_priorities %>% filter(priority %ilike% 'high') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english() %>% str_to_title()` crossings were rated as high priorities for proceeding to design for replacement, `r hab_site_priorities %>% filter(priority %ilike% 'Moderate') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english()` crossings were rated as moderate priorities, and `r hab_site_priorities %>% filter(priority %ilike% 'Low') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english()` crossings were rated as low priorities. Results are summarized in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("Figure \\@ref(fig:map-interactive) and ")}`Tables \@ref(tab:tab-overview) - \@ref(fig:plot-fish-all) with raw habitat and fish sampling data included in digital format as [Attachment 3](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_bulkley_2022_reporting/raw/master/data/habitat_confirmations.xls).  A summary of preliminary modelling results illustrating the quantity of chinook, coho and steelhead spawning and rearing habitat potentially available upstream of each crossing as estimated by measured/modelled channel width and upstream accessible stream length are presented in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-model-all). Detailed information for each site assessed with Phase 2 assessments (including maps) are presented within site specific appendices to this document.

### Fish Sampling

Fish sampling was conducted at `r tab_fish_sites_sum %>% n_distinct()` sites in Gramaphone Creek (6 sites upstream and 6 sites downstream of Telkwa High Road) with a total of `r hab_fish_indiv %>% filter(species_code != 'NFC') %>% nrow()` rainbow trout captured. Fork length data was used to delineate salmonids based on life stages: fry (0 to 65mm), parr (>65 to 115mm), juvenile (>115mm to 145mm) and adult (>145mm) by visually assessing the histograms presented in Figure \@ref(fig:fish-histogram).  A summary of sites assessed are included in Table \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-summary) and raw data is provided in [Attachment 3](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_bulkley_2022_reporting/raw/main/data/habitat_confirmations.xls). A summary of density results for all life stages combined of select species is also presented in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-all). Results are presented in greater detail within individual habitat confirmation site appendices.

## Phase 3

Engineering designs have been completed for replacement of PSCIS crossing 58159 on McDowell Creek [@irvine2021BulkleyRiver] with a clear-span bridge and for removal of the collapsed bridge (PSCIS crossing 197912) on Robert Hatch Creek.  Designs for McDowell and Robert Hatch were procured by SERNbc and Canadian Wildlife Federation respectively. At the time of reporting, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, in collaboration with Canadian Wildlife Federation was in the process of procuring designs for remediation of fish passage at three sites documented in @irvine2021BulkleyRiver including PSCIS 123445 on Tyhee Creek, PSCIS 124500 on Helps Creek and PSCIS 197640 on a tributary to Buck Creek.  Additionally, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure were procuring a design for PSCIS crossing 124420 on Station  Creek (also know as Mission  Creek) near New Hazleton (pers. comm. Sean Wong, Environmental Programs, MoTi).
