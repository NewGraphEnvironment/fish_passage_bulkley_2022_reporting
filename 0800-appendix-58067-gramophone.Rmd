## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` approximately 9km south of the community of
Witset, BC on
`r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`. Crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` was located
`r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km
upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River and is the
responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.


<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m at the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-58067)). Upstream of crossing
`r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously
been recorded [@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2020bcfishobs]. 


The site was revisited in 2023 to better understand fish presence by scoping for barriers, fish sampling to inform prioritization, and to serve as baseline monitoring if the crossing gets fixed. During the 2023 site visit, crews walked from the crossing down to the Bulkley River to assess barriers to fish passage. Approximately 500m upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River, crews observed a canyon with two falls at ~1.7m and a 25m rock chute. Coho were captured below the falls, therefore the falls are likely a barrier to Coho which explains the lack of Coho caught at crossing `r as.character(my_site)` upstream during the 2022 electrofishing survey. Crews also noted that the bottom few hundred meters of stream were de-watered, indicating that timing is an important factor for ocean run fish access to the stream. We believe that some of the fish we caught in 2022 could have been Steelhead due to the historic FISS Steelhead spawning point documented upstream of road, but the falls and de-watering likely explains the lack of coho in 2022.

The Gramophone Creek watershed is designated as
a Fisheries Sensitive Watershed under British Columbia's Forest
and Range Practices Act Government Actions Regulation, and the Oil and
Gas Activities Act Environmental Management and Protection Regulation.
Fisheries Sensitive Watersheds have significant fish values and are sensitive to changes in
habitat [@porter2015].

<br>


The Trout Creek/Moricetown watershed project was an integrated
restoration plan designed for 14 watersheds found on either side of the
Bulkley River. Gramophone Creek was included in the study area. A level
I sediment source assessment was conducted on the watershed. This
provided an overview and a risk assessment of sedimentation in pre
defined study blocks, which was then used to recommend further
restoration strategies. The risk assessment was used to determine if the
roads were on low, moderate, or high-risk terrain; and the consequence
that sedimentation could have on the road's associated fisheries stream.
Gramophone Creek scored lower than average overall on the risk
assessment but had some study blocks that required a level II assessment
[@sterlingwoodgroupinc_1997TroutCreek].

<br>

In a study conducted by [@porter2015], the Gramophone Creek stream
network was analysed using GIS methods to assess the risk status related
to fish habitat impact.  Risk status was determined by measuring nine habitat
indicators. These included: road density for the entire watershed, road
density above the H~60~ line (the elevation above which 60% of the
watershed area lies), road density less than 100m from a stream, stream
crossing density, proportion of stream logged, proportion of
fish-bearing stream logged, density of stream banks logged on slopes
greater than 60%, peak flow index, and road density on unstable slopes.
Measured values were compared to a baseline to classify risk as low,
moderate, or high. Of the 71 watersheds included in the analysis,
Gramophone Creek was notable for having all nine indicators rated as
high risk.

<br>

PSCIS stream crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a high
priority for follow up by the Canadian Wildlife Federation because of
significant amounts of habitat modelled upstream of the crossing. Upon
review of an assessment done on this crossing in 2012 by @gollner2013, @irvine2018AnalysisPriority ranked it as a high priority for follow up due to its high habitat value. A summary of
habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-58067). A map of the watershed is provided in

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered, had an outlet drop of `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = outlet_drop_meters)`m and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result)` to upstream fish
passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment]
(Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-58067)). The crossing consisted of two
pipes, with a very big outlet pool indicating the crossing was undersized. The pipes were noted as in poor condition due to corrosion and the road prism at the site had indications of significant erosion adjacent to the crossing. Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH
was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-58067-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-58067-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-58067-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` There were abundant undercut
banks available for cover. Some patches of gravel were present that
would be suitable for rainbow, steelhead and coho spawning. Occasional
deep pools were present that would serve as good habitat suitable for
fish rearing and overwintering. Riparian vegetation was mixed decidous and conifer old
growth forest. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for salmonid rearing and
spawning. 

In 2023 the site was revisited and crews walked from crossing `r as.character(my_site)` down to the Bulkley River and noted it was high value habitat. From crossing `r as.character(my_site)` to the confluence with Wiggs Creek, crews observed low water levels with sections of the stream de-watered, particularly in the first 300 m. There were isolated pools scattered approximately 30 to 50 m apart with pools up to 0.6 m deep. There was abundant algae in places of slow, moving water. Failing banks were encountered with barbwire fence swapped into the stream at multiple spots. There was occasional pockets of gravel present suitable for resident and anadromous salmonids. There was extensive cattle trampling within the channel at some locations. 

From the confluence of Wiggs Creek down to the Bulkley River there was high value habitat. Crews observed a canyon with two falls at ~1.7m and a 25m rock chute approximately 500m upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River (Figures \@ref(fig:canyon), \@ref(fig:chute), \@ref(fig:falls)). At the time of assessment, the bottom few hundred meters of stream were de-watered.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` There is a small beaver dam
\~500m upstream from the crossing. The stream is wide throughout with abundant cover and
some areas with gravels suitable for spawning. There is approximately
50m of open residential area on the right bank. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as an important
migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having
moderate rearing potential.

## Fish Sampling {.unnumbered}

Electrofishing was conducted in 2022 with results summarised in Tables
\@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-58067) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-58067) and
Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-58067).

In 2023 fish sampling was conducted below the observed falls using dip nets. Six Coho parr were captured and had a wide range of sizes (FL ranging from 65-90 mm) which suggests that spawning may have occurred at different times or rearing environments were more favourable (more food, warmer) for some, see figures \@ref(fig:fish1), \@ref(fig:fish2), \@ref(fig:fish3). Since Coho were captured below the falls but none at crossing `r as.character(my_site)` during the 2022 sampling, it is presumed that the falls are a barrier to Coho passage.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge
(`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at
\$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost
benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear
m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)`
m^2^/\$1000.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

There was
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of
habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with
areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for salmonid rearing and spawning.  `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
large system with habitat suitable for numerous species including coho salmon
and steelhead.   The crossings location adjacent to the community of
Witset, BC is ideal for community involvement in the project.  Additionally, because `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` is a non-paved road with a crossing location that can be accessed from either side, the costs of the work are low when compared to paved road and highway options. Crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for
proceeding to design for replacement.  Electrofishing results at the site indicated that the stream is productive in terms of rainbow trout however after the 2023 re-assessment, it is presumed the falls and de-watering located downstream are likely a barrier to Coho.
