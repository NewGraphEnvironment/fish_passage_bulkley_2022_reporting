## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, in the town of New Hazelton, BC. on
`r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`.  `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a tributary to Waterfall Creek which is in turn a tributary to Station Creek (a.k.a Mission Creek) with the Waterfall/Station confluence located approximately 4km downstream of the 10th avenue/Highway 16 crossing. The stream was labelled in @donas2022WaterfallCR as North Waterfall Creek however this name has not been assigned in the freshwater atlas.  The subject stream is mapped incorrectly in the BC freshwater atlas which documents it as a small drainage originating on the north side of Highway 16. In reality, the stream flows from an area south of town, through New Hazelton in a northern direction crossing under numerous road crossings and two CN railway crossings before joining with Waterfall Creek approximately 1.6km above where it joins Station Creek (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-waterfall)). Due to the large size of the stream in the areas surveyed and the small stream size of Waterfall Creek documented in PSCIS at crossing 124456 we suspect that our subject stream should potentially have been labelled Waterfall Creek in the freshwater atlas as it appears to contain the bulk of the flow in the watershed. 

<br>

During 2022 field surveys, three previously un-assessed stream crossings located upstream of the upper most railway culverts (PSCIS 124423) were surveyed for fish passage (PSCIS 198117 on 9th avenue, 198116 on Highway 16/10th avenue and 198115 on 13th avenue). Downstream of these three crossings the stream flows through six more road/rail crossings before it's confluence with Station Creek. A small bridge (modelled crossing 24704553 - a.k.a Mile 48) is located under the CN Railway approximately 875m upstream of the highway and at the time of reporting, there was an un-assessed crossing (1803294) on the subject tributary just upstream of it's confluence with Waterfall Creek. Site surveys downstream in Waterfall Creek in 2021 along with review of aerial imagery indicate that modelled crossing 1803294 likely does not exist as the stream appears to run adjacent to the railway at this location and not cross the road.  The location of modeled crossing 1803294 would need to be accessed from the west by crossing the CN Railway or from the east via a private road located behind gates to the New Hazelton sewage treatment facility.

<br>

Although the habitat confirmation assessment in this memo is detailed as for crossing 198116, the assessment conducted also covered areas downstream of 198117 and upstream of crossing 198115 so has significance for informing remediation of those culverts as well. The crossing locations were prioritized for follow up after field reconnaissance indicated that `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` was mapped incorrectly in the BC Freshwater Atlas stream network and likely contained significant quantities of high value habitat for coho spawning and rearing.

<br>

As the subject tributary to Waterfall Creek was not mapped in the freshwater atlas at the location of these crossings at the time of reporting, there were no road stream crossings modeled as present in `bcfishpass`.  As there were no crossings modeled, the software generated no estimates of fish habitat quantity. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = road_name)`, just downstream of 198116. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site3)` is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site3, col_pull = road_name)`, approximately 370m upstream of 198116. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on Hiighway 16/10th avenue is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure while crossings  `r as.character(my_site2)` and  `r as.character(my_site3)` are the responsibility of the District of New Hazelton.

## Background {.unnumbered}


In 2021, fish passage and habitat confirmation assessments were conducted on Waterfall Creek downstream of the upper railway crossing (PSCIS 124423) as well as on Station Creek at Highway 16 (PSCIS 124420).  Details of these assessments can be referenced in @irvine2022BulkleyRiver.   @wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage report that the crossing structure located on Highway 16 and Station Creek (PSCIS 124420) has been the subject of numerous assessments  and  designs  with  respect  to  the rehabilitation of fish passage, and they rated this crossing as the highest priority for rehabilitation in the Bulkley River watershed.  Gitxsan Watershed Authority reports that Xsan Xsagiibil was a fishing site located at the mouth of Station Creek (Xsi Gwin Sagiiblax) [@wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage].  Identified as a high priority for additional assessments by @rabnett_williams2004Highway16, @skrconsultantsltd_2006FishPassage conducted a detailed inspection, offered rehabilitation design options and  identified the natural limits of potential fish distribution to support rehabilitation efforts.  At the time of reporting, a design for remediation utilizing a retrofit of the existing structure to backwater the pipe was being drafted (Sean Wong, Environmental Programs Manager - Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure pers. comm.).

<br>

A trap and truck operation led by the Chicago Creek Community Environmental Enhancement Society moves coho from a fence set up near the confluence with the Bulkley River to upstream of Highway 16 on Waterfall Creek annually.  @houlden_etal2001ChicagoCreek report that the coho stocks in the system were wiped out in the late 1970s by the improper installation of PSCIS crossing 124420 located on Highway 16 west of New Hazelton. The Waterfall Creek Stream Rehabilitation Project began in 1990 to reintroduce coho to the stream with surplus stocks transplanted from Toboggan Creek near Smithers. In 1993 the Hazelton Elementary Streamkeepers program was developed to assist with the project and in 1995 the Chicago Creek Community Environmental Enhancement Society was incorporated to develop a hatchery nearby. The hatchery no longer operates but operations were considered successful with coho runs between 65 to over 1800 fish documented between 1998 - 2020 [@houlden_etal2001ChicagoCreek; @houlden_donas2002ChicagoCreek, @donas2022MissionCreek]. 

<br>

There is a rich history of past assessment and restoration work in the watershed that is summarized in @donas2022MissionCreek.  Work has included stream/habitat surveys, construction of spawning pads, riparian planting, construction of walkways/bridges and juvenile assessments [@donas2022MissionCreek; @nortecconsulting2000WaterfallCreek]. @donas2022MissionCreek is a watershed recovery plan for the greater Station Creek watershed that was submitted to Fisheries and Oceans Canada in March of 2022. The report details coho escapement information for 2002 - 2021 gathered from the "Mission Creek" fence noting numbers have fallen below the target of 400 in 10 out of 20 years. They summarize juvenile overwintering study results indicate a decline in catch per unit effort over the last 10 years with condition of juveniles noted as declining. The document lays out a list of threats affecting coho recovery in the system which among others include connectivity, habitat degradation, loss of riparian cover, beaver dam removals and potential water quality issues. Finally, the recovery plan lays out goals, objectives and recommended activities to stop and reverse the decline of coho in the watershed. 

<br>

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a second order stream. Upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, coho, cutthroat trout, rainbow trout and dolly varden have previously been recorded [@donas2022MissionCreek; @moe2020KnownBC; @norris2020bcfishobs]. A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [here](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/bulkley/FishPassage_093M.107.pdf).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()`
to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198116)). Water
temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH
was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')` past PSCIS crossing 198177 to adjacent to the CN railway approximately 220m upstream of PSCIS crossing 124423 `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198116-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198116-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198116-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` There is a culvert
approximately 100m downstream (PSCIS crossing 198117) that was also
assessed. At the time of survey, this crossing was un-embedded,
non-backwatered, and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198117)).The stream flows through the town of
New Hazelton. There was low flow at the time of survey and the stream
contained a lot of waste and debris. There was a lot of cover from
vegetation. The stream hits the railway and is drained into a tributary
that flows west until it joins Station Creek. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for salmonid rearing and
spawning.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')` to the location of a waterfall that blocks upstream migration for all life stages and species.

The waterfall was estimated to be approximately 7m in height. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` There was a culvert
approximately 400m upstream of PSCIS crossing 198116 that was also
assessed. At the time of survey, this crossing was un-embedded,
non-backwatered, and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198115)). The habitat quality was excellent.
The stream flow was moderate and there were fish spotted all the way up
to the waterfall where the survey ended. An adult coho was seen upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site3)`. Cover from vegetation
and undercut banks was noted as abundant. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as an important
migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having
high rearing potential for juvenile coho, rainbow trout, cuthtout trout and dolly varden.

<br>

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at \$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)` m^2^/\$1000.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

The Waterfall Creek system is part of the greater Station/Mission Creek watershed and located directly in the community of New Hazelton.  Although heavily impacted by urban and industrial development, this watershed provides valuable opportunities for public interaction with aquatic values and high potential for meaningful ecosystem function improvements. There is a long history of community led research, restoration and rehabilitation projects within the community which is likley to continue into the future through initiatives described in @donas2022MissionCreek. Although upstream migration of adult coho is unlikely to be hindered by the three crossings surveyed, conditions could degrade over time and passage through the structures by younger lifestages salmonids is likley already be prevented at some flows. Ongoing research, monitoring and advocy efforts by groups such as the Chicago Cr Community Environmental Enhancement Society, Skeena Watershed Conservation Coalition and the Gitskan Watershed Authorities indicate that biological conditions in the stream have been worsening overtime.  There was 1.2km of habitat upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` rated as`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`value for salmonid rearing and spawning with all three crossings considered
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priorities for proceeding to design for replacement. A further recommendation is that infrastructure upgrade dollars for the efforts also be leveraged towards alternative restoration activities such as riparian restoration, public education and research.
